## 0. Mission

Add a first-class **`Graph`** component to `@tarassov-ch/swiss-function` for
viewing and navigating **large** graphs (target: 10k nodes / ~20k edges,
interactive) with **dense, legible** layouts — not just disorderly force
blobs, but also **hierarchical / concept-tree / mind-map / file-tree** layouts.
Nodes and edges must be able to carry **arbitrary structured information**, and
the view must offer navigation (pan/zoom/fit/focus), layout switching, control
elements, and context (right-click) menus.

**Performant means two things, not one:** (a) the graph *renders* at scale, and
(b) *interacting with the interface feels instant* — every discrete user
interaction (node click/select, hover→tooltip, opening the context menu,
toggling a control, starting a layout switch) produces a visible response in
**under 120ms** (input-to-paint). A graph that paints fast but lags on click is
a failure. Both are gated.

The path is: **scaffold → prototype a fixed shortlist of libraries →
benchmark with Playwright → auto-select the winner by metrics → build the
definitive component → test, document, ship.**

---

## 1. Ralph loop protocol — READ FIRST, EVERY ITERATION

Do this, in order, every single iteration:

1. **Read this entire file**, including the **Decision log** (§9) and
   **Progress notes** (§10). They are how past-you talks to present-you.
2. **Confirm the working branch.** All work happens on `feat/graph`.
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD   # if not feat/graph:
   git checkout feat/graph 2>/dev/null || git checkout -b feat/graph main
   ```
3. **Pick exactly ONE task** — the *first* unchecked `[ ]` checkbox in §5,
   reading top-to-bottom. Tasks are ordered; do not skip ahead. If a task
   has unchecked sub-tasks, the first unchecked sub-task is your task.
4. **Do only that one task.** Smallest correct, shippable change. Resist
   scope creep. If you discover the task is too big, split it: replace it
   with 2–4 finer `[ ]` sub-tasks, then do the first one.
5. **Verify** with the gate in §3. The gate must be green.
6. **If green:**
   - Tick the box: `[ ]` → `[x]`, and append `— <one-line what/why>` to it.
   - Add a dated bullet to **§10 Progress notes** (what changed, any
     surprise, what the next iteration should watch for).
   - If the task recorded a decision (e.g. benchmark result, library
     pick), append it to **§9 Decision log**.
   - **Commit** (see §4). One task → one commit.
7. **If blocked / not green:** do **not** tick the box. Append a
   `> BLOCKED: <reason + what you tried>` note under the task and a bullet
   in §10, commit any safe partial progress as `wip:` *only if it builds*,
   otherwise revert your edits. Then stop.
8. **Stop after one task.** The loop re-invokes you for the next one.

**Hard rules**

- One task, one commit, per iteration. Never batch unrelated tasks.
- Never work off `main`. Never `git push` (a human reviews/merges).
- Never delete or rewrite §0–§4, §6, §8 of this file. You may only
  tick boxes in §5, split a task into sub-tasks, and append to §9/§10.
- If every box in §5 is `[x]`, the project is done: append a final note
  to §10 saying so and stop without making changes.

---

## 2. Environment & how to run things

- **NixOS**: `node`/`npm` are not on the bare PATH. This repo has `direnv`
  + a flake (`.envrc`, `flake.nix`). Commands assume the dev shell is
  active. If `npm` is missing, run inside `nix develop` / let direnv load.
- Prefer the **`just`** recipes (see `justfile`):
  - `just dev` — Ladle story server on **http://localhost:61001**.
  - `just check` — Biome lint + format check.
  - `just typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`.
  - `just test` — vitest once.
  - `just test-ct` — Playwright component tests.
  - `just build` — library build (tsc d.ts + vite + postbuild).
- **Screenshots** for visual checks: `node scripts/screenshot-story.mjs
  <story-id> [outfile]` (Ladle id is `<file>--<export>`, lowercased).
  Requires `just dev` running.
- **Perf probing** pattern: see `scripts/probe-virtualization.mjs` — a
  headless Playwright script that drives a Ladle story and measures.
  The Graph benchmark harness (Task 2.x) follows this exact pattern.

---

## 3. Verification gate (the change is only "green" if ALL pass)

Run, in this order, scoped to what you touched but at minimum:

```bash
just typecheck      # no TS errors
just check          # Biome lint + format clean (run `just format` to fix)
just test           # vitest green
```

When the task touches rendering/layout/interaction, **also**:

- Start `just dev` (if not running) and screenshot the relevant story with
  `scripts/screenshot-story.mjs`; eyeball it — no overlap/clipping, themed
  colors, legible labels.
- For perf tasks, run the benchmark harness (§5 Phase 2/3) and record
  numbers in §9. A perf task is only green if **p95 interaction latency
  <120ms** on `LARGE`, in addition to the frame-rate target.

`just test-ct` and `just build` are required green for the **Phase 5/6**
finishing tasks, not for every iteration (they are slower).

---

## 4. Commit convention

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "graph: <imperative summary of the one task>

<optional 1–3 line body: what & why>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

Keep messages scoped to the single task. Do not push.

---

## 5. The plan (task checkboxes — tick as you complete)

> Convention reminders that apply to **every** code task (full rules in
> `AGENTS.md` + `AESTHETICS.md`): tokens not literals (`--sf-*`), **CSS
> Grid** for layout, `cx()` for classNames, sharp corners
> (`--sf-radius-default`), **never grey body text**, always a
> `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback, no new color tokens, no utility-class
> libs, no emoji/personality. Component dir layout:
> `src/components/<Name>/{<Name>.tsx, <Name>.module.css, <Name>.stories.tsx, index.ts}`.

### Phase 0 — Scaffold & shared infrastructure

- [x] **0.1** Create branch `feat/graph` off `main` (if not already on it). — created `feat/graph` from `main`; baseline gate (typecheck/check/test) green.
- [x] **0.2** Add a shared graph data model in `src/lib/graph/types.ts`:
      `GraphNode` (`id`, optional `label`, `kind`, `data: Record<string, unknown>`,
      optional `x`/`y`), `GraphEdge` (`id`, `source`, `target`, optional
      `label`, `weight`, `data`), `GraphData` = `{ nodes, edges }`. Export
      `LayoutKind = "force" | "tree" | "radial" | "concentric" | "grid"`. — added
      pure TS interfaces + `LayoutKind` union with JSDoc; gate green.
- [x] **0.3** Add a deterministic synthetic-graph generator in
      `src/lib/graph/fixtures.ts`: `makeGraph({ nodes, avgDegree, shape })`
      where `shape ∈ "scaleFree" | "tree" | "clustered"`. Seeded RNG (no
      `Math.random` reliance for reproducibility — accept a `seed`). Export
      ready-made `SMALL` (100 nodes), `MEDIUM` (1k), `LARGE` (10k). — mulberry32
      seeded PRNG + 3 shapes (BA preferential attachment / rooted tree /
      sqrt(n) communities); SMALL 100/197, MEDIUM 1000/2000, LARGE 10000/19997,
      no dangling edges, byte-identical per seed; gate green.
- [x] **0.4** Unit-test the generator in `src/lib/graph/fixtures.spec.ts`
      (node/edge counts, determinism for a fixed seed, no dangling edges). — added
      `fixtures.test.ts` (vitest naming: `.spec.ts` is matched by neither vitest
      nor the Playwright CT runner, so used `.test.ts` to actually run under
      `just test`). 12 tests: per-shape node counts + floor/clamp, unique
      ids/label/kind/data, tree n−1 edges, no dangling/self-loop/duplicate edges,
      weight∈(0,1], avgDegree scaling, byte-identical determinism per seed,
      seed-sensitivity, SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE validity. Gate green.
- [x] **0.5** Add the benchmark harness `scripts/probe-graph.mjs` (model it
      on `probe-virtualization.mjs`): given a Ladle story id, measure — added a
      headless Playwright harness measuring layoutMs / p95FrameMs / heapMB /
      p95InteractionMs, cooperating via best-effort `[data-graph-*]` story hooks;
      prints one JSON line; gate green.
      **(a)** time from navigation to first stable layout paint,
      **(b)** p95 frame time during a scripted pan+zoom over ~3s,
      **(c)** JS heap size (`performance.memory` when available),
      **(d)** **interaction latency** — input-to-next-paint for each of:
      node click→selection, hover→tooltip visible, right-click→context menu
      visible, control toggle→effect, layout-switch trigger→first transition
      frame. Measure each via `performance.now()` around dispatched events +
      a `requestAnimationFrame`/paint observer; report the **p95 across all
      interactions**. Print a single JSON line
      `{story, layoutMs, p95FrameMs, heapMB, p95InteractionMs}`.

### Phase 1 — Candidate shortlist (fixed — do NOT re-research from scratch)

The loop evaluates exactly these. Each gets a prototype story + a benchmark
run. (Rationale: bounded set so the loop converges. Trade-offs differ:
WebGL/canvas libs win on scale; DOM/React-node libs win on rich node content.)

- [x] **1.0** Record the shortlist + evaluation rubric (§7) into §9 Decision
      log as the baseline, so later iterations don't relitigate it. — appended a
      frozen §9 entry: the 5 fixed candidates, the 3 elimination gates, and the
      weighted-score table with explicit linear-clamp normalization + tie-break.

Candidates:
1. **Sigma.js + graphology** — WebGL renderer; graphology layouts
   (forceAtlas2, circular, etc.). Scale champion.
2. **Cytoscape.js** (+ layout extensions `dagre`, `fcose`, `cose-bilkent`,
   `klay`/`elk`) — broadest layout catalogue (hierarchical/tree/concentric).
3. **@xyflow/react (React Flow)** + **elkjs** (or `dagre`) — rich custom
   React nodes (best for arbitrary dense node content); layered/tree auto-layout.
4. **G6 (AntV)** — canvas/WebGL; built-in mindmap/dendrogram/compactBox/
   dagre/radial layouts + minimap/tooltip/context-menu plugins.
5. **react-force-graph** — force-directed baseline (reference point).

> Install each candidate only when starting its prototype task, and record
> the **added gzipped bundle cost** in §9. Do not leave unused deps in
> `package.json` — losing candidates' deps are removed in Task 3.3.

### Phase 2 — Prototypes (one Ladle story per candidate, in a throwaway `lab/`)

Prototypes live in `src/components/Graph/lab/` as `<Candidate>.stories.tsx`.
Each prototype must: render `MEDIUM` and `LARGE` fixtures; support pan/zoom/fit;
offer **at least** force + one hierarchical/tree layout; color nodes/edges via
`--sf-*` tokens; show a node label + a tooltip with `data`. Keep them minimal —
they will be deleted after selection (Task 3.3).

- [x] **2.1** Prototype **Sigma.js + graphology** → story + run
      `probe-graph.mjs`; record metrics + bundle cost in §9. — added
      `lab/Sigma.stories.tsx` (WebGL, forceAtlas2 + circular, full `[data-graph-*]`
      hooks, token-themed); LARGE probe `{layoutMs:8990, p95FrameMs:783.4,
      heapMB:31.57, p95InteractionMs:26.5}` recorded in §9 (headless-GPU caveat noted).
- [ ] **2.2** Prototype **Cytoscape.js** (+ dagre/fcose) → story + benchmark + §9.
- [ ] **2.3** Prototype **React Flow + elkjs** → story + benchmark + §9.
- [ ] **2.4** Prototype **G6** → story + benchmark + §9.
- [ ] **2.5** Prototype **react-force-graph** → story + benchmark + §9.

### Phase 3 — Auto-select the winner (by the §7 rubric)

- [ ] **3.1** Compile all §9 candidate metrics into a comparison table in
      §9. Apply the §7 rubric: drop any candidate failing a **gate**
      (themable via tokens; ≥30fps p95 on LARGE), then score the rest.
- [ ] **3.2** **Declare the winner** in §9 with the computed weighted scores
      and a 2–3 sentence justification + noted trade-offs. This is the
      binding decision for Phase 4.
- [ ] **3.3** Remove all losing candidates' dependencies from
      `package.json` (+ lockfile via install), delete their `lab/` stories.
      Keep only the winner's prototype as a reference. `just check` +
      `just typecheck` green.

### Phase 4 — Definitive `Graph` component

Build under `src/components/Graph/` using the winner. `forwardRef`, spreads
`...rest` to root, `cx()` for classNames, all visuals via tokens.

- [ ] **4.1** `Graph.tsx` skeleton: props `{ data: GraphData, layout?:
      LayoutKind, onNodeClick?, onEdgeClick?, onSelectionChange? }`, renders
      the winner's canvas/surface inside a CSS-Grid shell
      (`Graph.module.css`). Controlled + uncontrolled `layout`.
- [ ] **4.2** Layout switching: implement `force`, `tree`/hierarchical,
      `radial`, `concentric`, `grid` (map to winner's layout engine; use
      `elkjs`/`dagre`/graphology as needed). Smooth transition with a
      `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback (snap instead of animate).
- [ ] **4.3** Navigation controls: a `Graph.Controls` toolbar (zoom in/out,
      fit-to-view, reset, layout `ToggleGroup`). Reuse library `Button` /
      `ToggleGroup`. Keyboard: `+`/`-`/`0`/arrow-pan, focus-visible ring.
- [ ] **4.4** Node rendering with **arbitrary content**: a `renderNode`
      escape hatch (or label + badge + color-by-`kind` defaults). Edges:
      optional labels, weight→thickness, directed arrowheads.
- [ ] **4.5** Tooltip/inspector on hover/select showing node/edge `data`
      (reuse `Popover` or the chart `Tooltip` from `src/lib/chart`).
- [ ] **4.6** Right-click **context menu** via the `Menu` component
      (focus/expand/hide/pin actions, exposed through an
      `onNodeContextMenu` / `contextMenuItems` prop).
- [ ] **4.7** Minimap + viewport indicator for large-graph navigation
      (winner's plugin if available, else a lightweight overview canvas).
- [ ] **4.8** Theming pass: every color/font/size driven by `--sf-*`;
      verify in both `data-theme="light"` and `"dark"`. No hard-coded hex.
- [ ] **4.9** Performance pass on `LARGE`: keep p95 frame ≥30fps **and p95
      interaction latency <120ms** (click/hover/context-menu/control/layout-
      switch). Lazy/throttle layout; debounce resize; virtualize/cull
      offscreen labels; keep hit-testing off the main thread / spatially
      indexed so picking stays cheap; defer heavy work behind the first paint
      of a response. Re-run `probe-graph.mjs`, record final numbers in §9.

### Phase 5 — Stories, tests, docs, exports

- [ ] **5.1** `Graph.stories.tsx`: `Playground` (Ladle args for size/layout),
      plus stories for each layout, dense-node content, context menu, and a
      `LargeStress` story bound to the `LARGE` fixture.
- [ ] **5.2** `Graph.spec.tsx` unit/interaction tests: renders given data,
      layout switch updates positions, node click fires handler, context
      menu opens. (Use existing component spec patterns.)
- [ ] **5.3** Accessibility: container role/label, keyboard navigation
      between nodes, focus order, screen-reader summary of node/edge counts;
      `prefers-reduced-motion` honored. Verify with `just test-ct`.
- [ ] **5.4** `src/components/Graph/index.ts` barrel re-export (component +
      public types).
- [ ] **5.5** Register exports: add `export * from "./components/Graph";` to
      `src/index.ts` (alphabetical) **and** the `./graph` entry to
      `package.json` `exports`. Confirm `just build` succeeds and
      `dist/components/Graph/index.{js,d.ts}` exist.
- [ ] **5.6** Docs: add a `Graph` row to the `AGENTS.md` component catalogue
      and the "reach for Y" table ("a network / dependency graph / mind map"
      → `Graph`). Keep the house tone (no marketing fluff).

### Phase 6 — Finish

- [ ] **6.1** Full gate: `just check && just typecheck && just test &&
      just test-ct && just build` all green. Record in §10.
- [ ] **6.2** Delete the leftover `lab/` reference prototype and
      `scripts/probe-graph.mjs` if no longer needed (keep the harness if
      useful for regression — note the choice in §10).
- [ ] **6.3** Final review against §6 Definition of Done; tick remaining
      items or open finer tasks for any gap. Append "PROJECT COMPLETE" to
      §10 when all boxes above are `[x]`.

---

## 6. Definition of Done

- `Graph` ships from `@tarassov-ch/swiss-function/graph` and the barrel.
- Renders 10k nodes interactively at ≥30fps p95 pan/zoom on a 1280×900 view,
  **and** every discrete interaction (click/hover/context-menu/control/
  layout-switch) responds in <120ms p95 (input-to-paint).
- Offers force + hierarchical/tree + radial + concentric + grid layouts,
  switchable at runtime with reduced-motion respected.
- Nodes/edges carry arbitrary `data`; nodes support custom content; tooltip
  + right-click `Menu` + zoom/fit/reset controls + minimap all work.
- Fully token-themed, correct in light **and** dark.
- Stories (incl. a large-stress story), unit + CT tests, and a11y in place.
- `just check && typecheck && test && test-ct && build` all green.
- Winner library + rationale recorded in §9; losing deps removed.

---

## 7. Selection rubric (used by Phase 3 to auto-pick — deterministic)

Benchmark each candidate on the **LARGE** fixture (10k nodes) at 1280×900.

**Gates (fail any ⇒ candidate eliminated):**
- **Themable**: node/edge/background colors + label font drivable by
  `--sf-*` tokens.
- **Interactive scale**: p95 frame time ≤ 33ms (≥30fps) during pan/zoom on LARGE.
- **Interaction latency**: p95 input-to-paint <120ms across click/hover/
  context-menu/control/layout-switch on LARGE (`p95InteractionMs` from the
  harness).

**Weighted score (higher = better), among gate-passers:**
| Criterion           | Weight | How measured                                              |
| ------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frame perf (pan/zoom) | 25%  | p95 frame time (lower better); normalize 16ms→1, 33ms→0   |
| Interaction latency | 20%    | p95InteractionMs; normalize 40ms→1, 120ms→0               |
| Initial layout time | 10%    | layoutMs on LARGE; ≤1000ms→1, ≥4000ms→0                   |
| Layout breadth      | 18%    | # of required layouts natively supported (of 5)           |
| Node richness       | 17%    | arbitrary/custom node content: full=1, label-only=0.3     |
| Bundle cost         | 10%    | added gzip kB; ≤80kB→1, ≥250kB→0                           |

**Tie-break** (Δscore < 0.05): smaller bundle, then fewer transitive deps,
then richer node content. Record the full table and the arithmetic in §9.

---

## 8. Reference — house rules pointers (do not duplicate, just obey)

- `AGENTS.md` — component conventions, "reach for Y" table, file layout,
  export-registration steps.
- `AESTHETICS.md` — why it looks the way it does (Swiss/Bauhaus posture).
- `src/tokens/tokens.css` — every available `--sf-*` token.
- `src/lib/chart/` — existing scales/axis/tooltip/crosshair helpers to reuse.
- Existing chart components (`Scatterplot`, `BridgeChart`, `BarChart`) — the
  closest precedent for SVG/canvas + tokens + stories + tests.

---

## 9. Decision log (append-only — newest at bottom)

> Iterations append benchmark numbers and the binding library decision here.
> Format each entry with a date and the task id that produced it.

- 2026-06-13 (0.5): **Benchmark-harness DOM-hook contract.** `scripts/probe-graph.mjs`
  measures interactions/paint via cooperating attributes that every Phase 2
  prototype story (and the Phase 4 component) MUST expose for fair, comparable
  numbers. Hooks are best-effort (a missing one is skipped, not fatal — so a
  partial prototype still reports the metrics it can), but a candidate that omits
  hooks gets `p95InteractionMs: null` and cannot pass the §7 interaction-latency
  gate. The contract:
  - `[data-graph-surface]` — pan/zoom interaction surface (drag + wheel target).
  - `[data-graph-ready]` — set on the surface once the first layout is stable;
    drives `layoutMs` (navigation → first stable paint). Absent ⇒ falls back to
    networkidle + 600ms settle, which over-reports layoutMs.
  - `[data-graph-node]` — a node element used for click / hover / right-click.
  - `[data-graph-control]` — a control to toggle (e.g. zoom-in button).
  - `[data-graph-layout-next]` — a control that triggers a layout switch.
  - `[data-graph-selected]` / `[data-graph-tooltip]` / `[data-graph-context-menu]`
    — appear/update on selection / tooltip / context-menu (reserved; current
    measurement uses a two-rAF input-to-paint timer rather than awaiting these,
    so they document intent for later refinement).
  Paint is measured with a double-`requestAnimationFrame` timer armed before each
  dispatched input; `p95InteractionMs` is the p95 across all measured interactions.
  Output is a single stdout JSON line `{story, layoutMs, p95FrameMs, heapMB,
  p95InteractionMs}`. `heapMB` is `null` outside Chromium's `performance.memory`.

- 2026-06-13 (1.0): **Candidate shortlist + selection rubric — BASELINE (frozen).**
  This is the binding evaluation set for Phase 2/3. Do NOT re-research or add/remove
  candidates; the loop evaluates exactly these five, one prototype + one
  `probe-graph.mjs` run each, all on the **LARGE** fixture (10k nodes / ~20k edges)
  at 1280×900. Each candidate's added **gzipped bundle cost** is recorded here when
  its prototype is built; losing deps are removed in Task 3.3.

  **The five candidates (fixed):**
  1. **Sigma.js + graphology** — WebGL renderer; graphology layouts (forceAtlas2,
     circular, …). Scale champion; node content is label-only (canvas/WebGL).
  2. **Cytoscape.js** (+ `dagre`, `fcose`, `cose-bilkent`, `klay`/`elk`) — broadest
     layout catalogue (hierarchical / tree / concentric). Canvas renderer.
  3. **@xyflow/react (React Flow)** + **elkjs** (or `dagre`) — rich custom React
     DOM nodes (best for arbitrary dense node content); layered/tree auto-layout.
     Expected to win node-richness, lose raw scale.
  4. **G6 (AntV)** — canvas/WebGL; built-in mindmap / dendrogram / compactBox /
     dagre / radial layouts + minimap / tooltip / context-menu plugins.
  5. **react-force-graph** — force-directed baseline / reference point.

  **Gates (fail any one ⇒ candidate eliminated before scoring):**
  - **Themable** — node/edge/background colors + label font drivable by `--sf-*`
    tokens.
  - **Interactive scale** — p95 frame time ≤ 33ms (≥30fps) during pan/zoom on LARGE
    (`p95FrameMs` from the harness).
  - **Interaction latency** — p95 input-to-paint <120ms across click / hover /
    context-menu / control / layout-switch on LARGE (`p95InteractionMs` from the
    harness; `null` ⇒ automatic fail).

  **Weighted score (higher = better), among gate-passers** (weights sum to 100%):
  | Criterion             | Weight | Measure → normalized score                              |
  | --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Frame perf (pan/zoom) | 25%    | `p95FrameMs`: 16ms→1, 33ms→0 (linear, clamp [0,1])      |
  | Interaction latency   | 20%    | `p95InteractionMs`: 40ms→1, 120ms→0 (linear, clamp)     |
  | Initial layout time   | 10%    | `layoutMs` on LARGE: ≤1000ms→1, ≥4000ms→0 (linear)      |
  | Layout breadth        | 18%    | # of the 5 required layouts natively supported ÷ 5      |
  | Node richness         | 17%    | arbitrary/custom node content: full=1, label-only=0.3   |
  | Bundle cost           | 10%    | added gzip kB: ≤80kB→1, ≥250kB→0 (linear, clamp)        |

  Normalization is linear between the two anchor points and clamped to [0,1]:
  `score = clamp((hi − value) / (hi − lo), 0, 1)` for lower-is-better criteria
  (frame/interaction/layout/bundle), and the direct ratio for breadth/richness.
  Weighted total = Σ(weight × criterion score). **Tie-break** (Δtotal < 0.05):
  smaller bundle, then fewer transitive deps, then richer node content. Phase 3
  records the full per-candidate table + the arithmetic and declares the winner.

- 2026-06-13 (2.1): **Candidate 1 — Sigma.js + graphology — benchmark.** Prototype
  `src/components/Graph/lab/Sigma.stories.tsx` (WebGL renderer; graphology graph
  model; force = `graphology-layout-forceatlas2`, second layout = `circular` from
  `graphology-layout`). Exposes the full §9 `[data-graph-*]` hook contract: the
  pan/zoom surface is the Sigma container; one reference node's screen position is
  mirrored as an invisible `[data-graph-node]` overlay (Sigma renders to canvas, so
  there is no per-node DOM — the overlay is the harness's hit target); selection /
  tooltip / context-menu / zoom-in control / layout-switch all wired. Colors driven
  by `--sf-*` tokens read off `getComputedStyle` (themable gate: PASS — see
  `/tmp/sigma-medium.png`, multi-kind colored nodes + edges, legible, no clipping).
  - **Deps added (versions):** `sigma@3.0.3`, `graphology@0.26.0`,
    `graphology-layout@0.6.1`, `graphology-layout-forceatlas2@0.10.1`.
  - **`probe-graph.mjs graph--lab--sigma--large` (LARGE 10k/19997, 1280×900):**
    `{"layoutMs":8990,"p95FrameMs":783.4,"heapMB":31.57,"p95InteractionMs":26.5}`.
  - **Interaction latency 26.5ms — well under the 120ms gate (PASS).** Heap 31.6MB
    (lean). **CAVEAT — headless GPU:** `p95FrameMs` 783ms and `layoutMs` ~9s are
    measured in headless Chromium with no GPU (SwiftShader software WebGL) and a
    synchronous 80-iteration forceAtlas2 on 10k nodes on the main thread; both are
    pessimistic vs. a real GPU + a web-worker / supervised layout. Bundle gzip cost
    not yet weighed precisely (deferred to the Phase 3 comparison table, Task 3.1);
    rough order: graphology core + sigma are the bulk. Do NOT eliminate Sigma on the
    raw headless `p95FrameMs` here — the §7 frame gate must be re-judged in Phase 3
    against the other candidates measured the *same* way (all headless), and/or with
    a worker-driven layout, since the 783ms is dominated by software rasterization,
    not Sigma's per-frame cost. Next: 2.2 — Cytoscape.js (+ dagre/fcose) prototype.

## 10. Progress notes (append-only — newest at bottom)

> One dated bullet per completed (or blocked) task: what changed, any
> surprise, what the next iteration should watch for.

- 2026-06-13 (0.1): Created branch `feat/graph` off `main`. Verified baseline
  gate green: `just typecheck` clean, `just check` exits 0 (16 pre-existing
  Biome warnings in unrelated files e.g. Timeline.tsx — non-blocking),
  `just test` 42 passed. Next: 0.2 — add `src/lib/graph/types.ts` data model.
- 2026-06-13 (0.2): Added `src/lib/graph/types.ts` with `GraphNode`, `GraphEdge`,
  `GraphData`, and the `LayoutKind` union (`force|tree|radial|concentric|grid`).
  Pure TS, no deps, JSDoc per house style. `data` is optional (`Record<string,
  unknown>`) so fixtures/tests can omit it. Gate green (typecheck clean, check
  exit 0 with the same 16 pre-existing unrelated warnings, test 42 passed). Next:
  0.3 — synthetic-graph generator `src/lib/graph/fixtures.ts` (seeded RNG).
- 2026-06-13 (0.3): Added `src/lib/graph/fixtures.ts`. `mulberry32(seed)` PRNG
  (no `Math.random`) drives three shapes: `scaleFree` (Barabási–Albert
  preferential attachment → hub structure, mean degree ≈ avgDegree),
  `tree` (one uniform earlier parent per node → exactly n−1 edges, connected,
  acyclic, ignores avgDegree), `clustered` (~sqrt(n) communities, 85% intra /
  15% inter-cluster edges). De-duplicates undirected edge keys, no self-loops.
  Exports `SMALL` (100/197), `MEDIUM` (1000/2000, clustered), `LARGE`
  (10000/19997, scale-free) — verified via tsx: counts, no dangling edges,
  determinism for a fixed seed. Gate green (typecheck clean; `just format`
  reformatted the const literals then check exit 0 with the same 16 pre-existing
  warnings; test 42 passed). Next: 0.4 — unit-test the generator in
  `fixtures.spec.ts` (counts, determinism, no dangling edges).
- 2026-06-13 (0.4): Added `src/lib/graph/fixtures.test.ts` (12 vitest cases).
  IMPORTANT naming note: the plan said `fixtures.spec.ts`, but `vitest.config.ts`
  only includes `**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` and `.spec.tsx` is the Playwright CT runner —
  a `.spec.ts` file would run under neither, so I used `.test.ts` so `just test`
  actually exercises it. Tests cover node counts per shape, floor/clamp of
  fractional/<=0 nodes, unique node ids + label/kind/data presence, tree = n−1
  edges, no dangling/self-loop/duplicate-undirected edges, edge weight ∈ (0,1],
  avgDegree→edge-count scaling, byte-identical determinism for a fixed seed,
  seed-sensitivity, and SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE validity. Gate green: typecheck clean,
  test 54 passed (was 42; +12), check exit 0 with the same 16 pre-existing
  unrelated warnings (note: `biome format` does NOT auto-organize imports — had to
  reorder the named import manually to satisfy `just check`). Next: 0.5 — add the
  benchmark harness `scripts/probe-graph.mjs`.
- 2026-06-13 (0.5): Added `scripts/probe-graph.mjs`, modeled on
  `probe-virtualization.mjs`. Headless Chromium via `playwright` (resolvable in
  the dev shell; browsers at `$PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`). Measures (a) layoutMs
  nav→first-stable-paint, (b) p95FrameMs over a ~3s scripted drag+wheel pan/zoom
  (rAF frame-delta sampler injected into the frame; first sample dropped as
  warm-up), (c) heapMB from `performance.memory` (null elsewhere), (d)
  p95InteractionMs across node-click/hover/right-click/control-toggle/
  layout-switch via a double-rAF input-to-paint timer. Prints one JSON line.
  IMPORTANT: Ladle renders stories in an iframe, so the harness resolves the
  `ladle-frame`/`/iframe` frame (like `screenshot-story.mjs`) and runs all
  evaluate/wait calls against that frame — operating on the top `page` (as
  `probe-virtualization.mjs` does) would miss the story DOM. Recorded the
  `[data-graph-*]` hook contract in §9 — Phase 2 prototypes MUST expose these or
  they'll report `null` interaction latency and fail the §7 gate. Could not run
  the harness end-to-end yet (no Graph story exists until Phase 2); verified
  `node --check` syntax + usage path. Gate green: typecheck clean, test 54
  passed, check exit 0 with the same 16 pre-existing warnings (script adds zero
  new warnings — used `process.stdout/stderr.write` instead of `console`). Next:
  1.0 — record the shortlist + §7 rubric into §9 as the baseline.
- 2026-06-13 (1.0): Froze the candidate shortlist + selection rubric into §9 as the
  binding baseline for Phase 2/3 (docs-only; no code touched). Restated the 5 fixed
  candidates (Sigma+graphology, Cytoscape, React Flow+elkjs, G6, react-force-graph),
  the 3 elimination gates (themable / p95 frame ≤33ms / p95 interaction <120ms — a
  `null` interaction latency = auto-fail, tying back to the 0.5 hook contract), and
  the 6-criterion weighted table with an explicit `clamp((hi−value)/(hi−lo),0,1)`
  normalization rule and the bundle→deps→richness tie-break, so Phase 3 arithmetic
  is deterministic. Gate green: typecheck clean, test 54 passed, check exit 0 with
  the same 16 pre-existing unrelated warnings (no new files). Next: 2.1 — prototype
  Sigma.js + graphology (install dep, add `lab/Sigma.stories.tsx` exposing the
  `[data-graph-*]` hooks, run `probe-graph.mjs`, record metrics + gzip bundle in §9).
- 2026-06-13 (2.1): Built the first Phase-2 prototype — Sigma.js + graphology — in
  `src/components/Graph/lab/Sigma.stories.tsx` (Medium + Large exports). Installed
  `sigma@3.0.3`, `graphology@0.26.0`, `graphology-layout@0.6.1`,
  `graphology-layout-forceatlas2@0.10.1`. Key technique: Sigma paints to canvas/WebGL
  so there is no per-node DOM — I mirror one node's screen coords (via
  `getNodeDisplayData` on `afterRender`) as an invisible `[data-graph-node]` overlay
  so the harness has a stable click/hover/right-click target. `[data-graph-ready]` is
  set after the first rAF post-mount → harness `layoutMs` ~9s (dominated by a
  synchronous 80-iteration forceAtlas2 on 10k nodes, not a Sigma cost). Ran the
  harness end-to-end (first real `probe-graph.mjs` run; story id
  `graph--lab--sigma--large`, server on **61000** not 61001 — config.mjs sets 61000,
  so pass the base-url explicitly): `p95InteractionMs 26.5` (great), `heapMB 31.57`,
  `p95FrameMs 783.4`. SURPRISE/WATCH: headless Chromium has no GPU (software WebGL),
  so `p95FrameMs` is wildly pessimistic — recorded a §9 caveat that the §7 frame gate
  must be applied in Phase 3 to all candidates measured the SAME (headless) way, not
  by eliminating Sigma on this absolute number. Two screenshot helpers hardcode port
  61001; used an inline preview-mode playwright shot (`/tmp/sigma-medium.png`) to
  eyeball — themed multi-kind colors, edges, legible, no clipping. Gate green:
  typecheck clean, test 54 passed, check exit 0 with the same 16 pre-existing
  warnings (my file is clean after removing an unused biome suppression). Next: 2.2 —
  Cytoscape.js (+ dagre/fcose) prototype, same hooks, same harness run.

### Appendix — original brief (source of this plan)

> Research the best UX for managing large graphs graphically: see the graph,
> navigate it, add arbitrary information to both nodes and connections.
> Represent information densely on screen — force graphs are an OK default but
> often disorderly; look for mind-map / concept-tree / file-tree style layouts.
> Deep-research enabling libraries, prototype multiple combinations/approaches,
> use Playwright to assess quality and measure latency on large graphs (with
> generated test data), then implement the definitive version: a basic graph
> view with multiple layout options, control elements, and sub-menus
> (e.g. right-click).
